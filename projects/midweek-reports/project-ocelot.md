# Project OCELoT mid-week report, August 28, 2019

## Progress

Some initial progress compared to the MTMA19 version:
- Basic object model design for `Campaign`, `Challenge` and `Team` objects;
- Clarified scope for MTM19 project week;
- Added JSON data field to `TestSet` class.

## Next steps

- Get WMT19 data into http://ocelot.mteval.org/ and create initial accounts for testing;
- Add submission code and auto-updating leaderboard based on SacreBLEU scoring;
- Add primary submission selection logic for "leaderboard freeze".

This would implement the basic flow of an OCELoT campaign.
